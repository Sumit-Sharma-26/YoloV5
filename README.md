# YoloV5-Object-Detection


In this project, we are trying to Detect the object using the PyTorch of python which is developed by Facebook.

we first clone the repository of the YoloV5 and extracted the model and train that model on our train set and then tested it on the test set of the data.

## Modules used:
* torch (pytorch)
* utils

## To Run the object detection
run this notebook into the google colab
```
run in google colab
```
## Deployment
```
1. Load the necessary Modules
2. Initialize the function of the Modules
3. unziping the loaded repository.
4. training the yolo model.
5. Tested the model on the test set.
